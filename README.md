# Best WiFi Channel

This project has been made as an assignment for my university. The goal of the project is to find the best channel for the user's WiFi, so it has less interference from the WiFi of his neighbors. The application was developed in Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) and preinstalled tools were used to run it.
